This is a simple comandline file exporer script for windows :desktop_computer::notebook_with_decorative_cover: written in Python 3.9

### Functions:
	- Traverse through you computers files as you wish with classical comandline interface and intuitve text control
	- High level file operations such as: Copy, move, delete files and folders ~~ as well as Create Folders ~~ (not yet)
	- Function which prompts user to select x amount of files/dirs (which I will use for other projects) 
	Within Config file and while using the application:
		- Changable standart diretory 
		- ~~ Create, use and delete Quick Access Points ~~ (not yet)
	Startparameter: start directory (prioritized over config)

Additional things I want to add:
- [ ] Full functionality
- [ ] Quick Access Points
- [ ] Test in linux
- [ ] Write Unittest
- [ ] Create Folders
- [ ] Better sys.argv usage / options
- [ ] write function when imported to promt user to choose file
